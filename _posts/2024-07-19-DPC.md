Welcome to GitHub Pages and Jekyll 🎉!

The first step is to enable GitHub Pages on this repository. When you enable GitHub Pages on a repository, GitHub takes the content that's on the main branch and publishes a website based on its contents.

You turned on GitHub Pages! 🎉

We'll work in a branch, my-pages, that I created for you to get this site looking great. ❇️

Jekyll uses a file titled _config.yml to store settings for your site, your theme, and reusable content like your site title and GitHub handle. You can check out the _config.yml file on the Code tab of your repository.

Nice work setting the theme! ✨

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an index.md file or the README.md file. GitHub Pages first looks for an index.md file. Your repository has an index.md file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

Your home page is looking great! 🤠

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll. In Jekyll, we can create a blog by using specially named files and frontmatter. The files must be named _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md. You must also include title and date in your frontmatter.

What is frontmatter?: The syntax Jekyll files use is called YAML frontmatter. It goes at the top of your file
